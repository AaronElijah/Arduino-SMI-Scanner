# Arduino-SMI-Scanner
An SMI scanner that loops through all PHY and REG addresses and returns read data. Uses a bit banger configured for Arduino Uno.

Credit goes to Russell Liu (2014-9-18 <russell_liu@davicom.com.tw>) for original bit banger code in Arduino UNO. I generalised that code into making a scanner that will scan all register and device addresses.
